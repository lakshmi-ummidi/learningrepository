 * When we do commit it creates a snapshot(with particular id) or it is telling git that you are ready to push those changes to your remote. It is like a giant copy & paste method.
* The commit id's represent at that particular commit timing what was actually there in your local files which you pushed on github.
* The recent commit will be connected in ancestory form with previous commit. It means the recent commit will inherit from previous commits.
** <git push origin master> ** //To push files which we commited to remote repository.
